# rubyconf2019.artichoke.run

This repository deploys a [snapshot] of [artichoke.run] that corresponds to the
deployment at the time of the [RubyConf 2019 presentation about Artichoke].

The [2019 RubyConf presentation] embeds [artichoke.run] in several iframes. The
demo includes functionality in [artichoke.run] that may be removed in subsequent
upstream releases. Deploying a snapshot of [artichoke.run] that is known to
operate the demos in the RubyConf 2019 presentation ensures the deck continues
to function.
